## Architecture

LearnHub follows a **Client-Server Architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Handles user interface, form submissions, complaint tracking, dashboards, and live chat interface.
- **Backend**: Manages business logic, data validation, routing, user authentication, and RESTful API provisioning.
- **Database**: Stores user profiles, complaints, messages, attachments, and system configurations.
- **APIs**: Define standardized JSON-based communication between the frontend and backend.
- **External Services**: Handle notifications via email/SMS for real-time user updates.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Material UI, Bootstrap, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend), Render or Vercel Serverless Functions (Backend)

---

## Data Flow

1. The user interacts with the frontend by submitting complaints, viewing statuses, and chatting with agents.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend using Axios to send and receive data.
3. The backend processes requests, performs validation, and interacts with MongoDB for data persistence.
4. Socket.io enables real-time communication for live chat and instant updates on complaint statuses.
5. Notifications are triggered and sent to users via email/SMS based on complaint events.
6. The frontend updates the UI dynamically to reflect the latest data without requiring manual refreshes.

---

## Security

Security has been integrated at every layer of LearnHub:

- JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Customers, Agents, and Administrators
- HTTPS encryption for all frontend-backend communications
- Data encryption at rest where applicable
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks and XSS vulnerabilities
- Logging and monitoring for auditing critical actions
- Rate limiting and API security best practices

---

## Deployment

The project is deployed using **Vercel** for both the frontend and backend:

- Automatic deployments from GitHub with preview URLs for each pull request
- Custom domains, HTTPS, and environment variable management through Vercel
- Serverless functions used for backend routes if needed
- MongoDB Atlas connected securely to the deployed backend

This ensures minimal downtime, scalability under load, and a seamless developer experience for updates and feature rollouts.
